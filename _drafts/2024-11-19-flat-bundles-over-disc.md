First we want to define the key objects that allow us to define affine surfaces as holomorphic (or meromorphic) sections of some bundle. We will first develop the local theory and consider the punctured unit disc and flat line bundles over it.

## Flat bundles

In short, we call a bundle flat if it admits a bundle atlas in which all the transition functions are constant. Here is a more verbose version:

<div class="definition">
    <strong>Definition.</strong> We call a vector bundle $ V \rightarrow E \rightarrow X $ flat if there is an open cover $\mathcal{U} = \{U_\alpha\}$ of $X$ and an atlas $\mathcal{A} = \{ \phi_\alpha: \pi\inv(U_\alpha) \rightarrow U_\alpha \times V \}$
</div>
