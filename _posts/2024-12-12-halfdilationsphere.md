excerpt: This post collects thoughts and experiments regarding a certain family of halfdilation structures on the sphere with $n+1$ singularities.

For every triangulable dilation structure $q$ on $S_{0,n+1}$, we can construct a unique delaunay polygonization $T$.


- Action of the pure mapping class group and of PSL(2,R) on DT for the four punctured torus
- TD as a bundle over H^1(S_0,4, R^*)
- The quotient descends to a bundle over H^1(S_0,4, R^*)
